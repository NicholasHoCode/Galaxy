    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Statistics at the <a href='http://www.ubc.ca/'STYLE="text-decoration: none">University of British Columbia</a> Vancouver in May 2017. My interests are in mathematics, statistical modeling, software development, machine learning, computer vision & scientific computing. When I write code I usually do it in Python, R and MATLAB, but historically I’ve used Java (hence, a good basic understanding of C#) and a fair amount of C/C++  and Javascript. Most of what I’ve been doing last few years has been machine learning and back-end development (modeling database and designing RESTful services). In my spare time, I enjoy solving Project Euler problems, hacking on large datasets (terabytes of data), implementing interesting ideas in research papers from scratch and designing (and back-testing) my trading algorithms. </p>
	<h3> Experience </h3>
    <p> From January to April 2016, I was an intern at a Montréal based quantitative hedge fund specializing in algorithmic trading where I worked on various projects in model analysis (e.g. forecasting, detecting and analyzing large move in machine quotes on equity ETFs). In summer 2016, I collaborated with Professor Bernard D. Shizgal (UBC Statistical Mechanics Research Group) and together we worked on a pseudo-spectral algorithm based on non-classical orthogonal polynomials for quantum mechanical modeling in DFT (Density Functional Theory). <b>Peer-reviewed publication:</b> <a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10910-016-0689-5'STYLE="text-decoration: none"> Shizgal, B.D., Ho, N. & Yang, X. J Math Chem (2017) 55: 413. doi:10.1007/s10910-016-0689-5 </a>. In summer 2015, I interned at one of the largest financial market operators in the world (HKEX Group). As a systems engineer, I assisted controls engineers on projects and daily tasks and gained fundamental understanding of the stock exchange's control systems and data center design. In addition, I also worked cross-functionally with design, construction, and software teams. </p>
